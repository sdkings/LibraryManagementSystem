# Group work break-down strategy
For this group project, all 4 of us decided to play our strengths. Harveer took charge as the leader and decided to split the work amongst us, since he is the best at sqlite and python. Daman, who is the second best decided to start working on the user class and the login page. Meanwhile, Bakhshish and Sapandeep worked on the SQL queries, and Sapandeep also took charge of integrating all of those into python using the sqlite3 library. The project took around 2 weeks to build, and we all worked on our separate machines at home, sometimes pushing our work into the branches we had created on github. In full detail: Daman worked on the member profile task, Sapandeep worked on the returning a book and paying the penalty task, while Bakhshish wroked on the searching a book and borrowing task. Harveer had the job of supervising and helping everyone, while also providing inputs for the main code and bringing the entire project together.

Hours worked per team member (approximate):
Harveer - 25
Sapandeep - 20
Daman - 20
Bakhshish - 15

For establishing communication and proper coordination: group chats, google meet, git branches for proper organization, regular meetings in Cameron and Rutherford libraries
